## Data Exploration Analysis

1. Class imbalance
2. Number of features
3. Feature types: discrete, continuous
4. Feature statistics: mean, min, max, median, number of missing data
5. Are there any bias in the data? What kinds of biases are present? How do we correct i

## Feature Engineering

1. **For both Continuous & Categorical features**

   1. Handling missing data

      1. Deletion

         1. Row Deletion: if a data point has many missing values
         2. Column Deletion: if a feature has many missing values
      2. Imputation

         1. Defaults
         2. Mean, Median, or Mode(the most common value)
   2. Deiscretization( Bucketing)

      1. Convert a continuous feature into a categorical feature
      2. Reduce the number of categories for a categorical feature
2. **For only Continuous features**

   1. Feature scaling: scaling features to have a standard range and distribution

      1. Normalization (min-max scaling)
         z = (x - x_min) / (x_max - x_min)
         Normalizaiton doesn't change the distribution of the feature.
      2. Standardization (Z-score normalization)

         1. z = (x- u) / sigma
            Standardization changes the distribution of the feature
      3. Log scaling

         1. z = log(x)
         2. Mitigate the skewness of a feature, and enable the optimization algorithm to converge faster
3. **For only Categorical features**
   convert categorical features into numeric representation

   1. integer encoding
      1. This method is useful if the integer values have a natural relationship with each other(ordinal), such as excellent/good/bad -> 1/2/3
   2. one-hot encoding
      1. red/greed/blue ->100/010/001
   3. embedding encoding
      1. An embedding is a mapping of a categorical feature into a N-dimensional vector.
      2. This method is useful when the number of unique values the feature takes is very large. In this case, one-hot encoding is not a good option because it leads to very large vector sizes.
4. **For Images**

   Steps

   1. Resize
   2. Normalization
   3. Data augmentation (Userful for class imbalance, and the model can learn more complex pattern)
      1. Random crop
      2. Rescale
      3. Random saturation / brightness
      4. Vertical / horizontal flip
      5. Rotation / translation
      6. Mix up
      7. Mosaic
      8. Add noise
5. **For Text**

   1. Text Normalization        E.g. "A person is walking in the street." -> "A person walk in the street"
      1. Lowercasing
      2. Punctuation removal
      3. Trim whitespaces
      4. Normalization Form KD: TODO
      5. Strip accents
      6. Lemmatization and stemming
   2. Tokenization            ['a', 'person', 'walk', 'in', 'the', 'street']
      1. Word tokenization
      2. Subword tokenization
      3. Character tokenization
   3. Tokens to IDs          [33, 20, 8, 25, 70]
      1. Lookup table
      2. Hashing
   4. Text encoder
      1. Statistical methods
         1. BoW
         2. TF-IDF
      2. ML-based methods
         1. Embedding (lookup) Layer
         2. Word2vec
         3. Transformer-based models
6. For video

   1. Decode frames
   2. Sample frames
   3. Preprocess like images
      1. Resize
      2. Scale, normalize, correcting color mode
7. TODO

## Collect Labels

1. Hand labeling
   1. How good is the label
2. Natural labeling
   1. How do we get them
   2. How do we receive user feedback on the system
   3. How long does it take to get natural labels

## Handle Class Imbalance

1. Resampling training data
   1. Oversampling
   2. Downsampling
   3. Stratified sampling
   4. Importance weighted sampling
   5. Reservoir sampling
   6. Convenience sampling
2. Altering loss function
   1. Class weighted loss
   2. Class balanced loss
   3. Focal Loss

## Train / Test Split

Divide the dataset into training, validation, test splits, often in 70%, 20%, 10%.

Usually these metrics are tied to business objectives.

| Video recommendation      | Click-through rate, total watch time, number of completed videos, etc.     |
| Friend recommendation     | Number of requests sent per day, number of requests accepted per day, etc. |

# Model Deployment

## Cloud vs. on-device deployment

TODO

## Model compression

To make a model smaller, it can reduce

1. the inference latency
2. model size

### Knowledge distillation

To train a small model (student) to mimic a larger model (teacher).

### Pruning

To find the least useful parameters and set them to zero.

Then we can have a sparser model, and we can store it more efficiently.

### Quantization

Usually, the model is represented with 32-bit floating numbers.

Here, we can can reduce the model size by using fewer bits, such as half model with 16-bit floating numbers.

It can happen during training or post-training.

## Test in production

### Shadow deployment

Deploy the new model in parallel with the existing model.

Each incoming request is routed to both models, but only the existing model's prediction is served to the user.

Pros: minimize the risk of unreliable predictions

cons: expensive

### A/B testing

Deploy the new model in parallel with the existing model.

A portion of the traffic is routed to the newly developed model, such as 5% of the traffic.

Two things to keep in mind for A/B testing:

1. The traffic routed to each model has to be random.
2. A/B test should be run on a sufficient number of data points in order for the results to be legitimate.

### Batch/Online Prediction

| Type              | Pros                                                              | Cons                                                                                                              | Use cases                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch Prediction  | No worry about inference time, as it is pre-computed periodically | 1. Less responsive to the chaning preference of users<br />2. Only possible if we know in advance what to compute | 1. Need to process a large volume of data<br />2. The results are not needed in real time |
| Online Prediction |                                                                   | 1. May take too long to generate predictions                                                                      | 1. We do not know what to compute in advance                                              |

### Real-time features

Is real-time access to features possible?

What are the challenges?

TODO

# Monitor

## Why a system fails in production

### Data Distribution Shift

Solutions:

1. Train on large datasets
2. Regularly retrain the model using labeled data from the new distribution

## What to Monitor

### Operation-related metrics

To ensure the system is up and running

1. Average serving time
2. thoughput
3. the number of prediction requests
4. CPU/GPU utilization

### ML specific metrics

1. Input/ouput monitoring
2. Input/output distribution
3. Accuracy of the model: expect to be in a specific range
4. Model versions
